description: >
  The main state object containing all device state properties including lighting state,
  effects, segments, and various control options. This is the core object for controlling
  WLED device behavior.
properties:
  on:
    type: boolean
    description: On/Off state of the light
    example: true
  bri:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 255
    description: >
      Brightness of the light. If on is false, contains last brightness when light was on
      (aka brightness when on is set to true). Setting bri to 0 is supported but it is
      recommended to use the range 1-255 and use on: false to turn off. The state response
      will never have the value 0 for bri.
    example: 128
  transition:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 255
    description: >
      Duration of the crossfade between different colors/brightness levels. One unit is 100ms,
      so a value of 4 results in a transition of 400ms.
    example: 7
  tt:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 255
    description: >
      Similar to transition, but applies to just the current API call. Not included in state response.
    example: 4

    type: integer
    minimum: -1
    maximum: 65535
    description: >
      ID of currently set preset. 1~17~ can be used to iterate through presets 1-17.
      -1 indicates no preset is active.
    example: 1
  psave:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 250
    description: >
      Save current light config to specified preset slot. Not included in state response.
      Range is 1 to 16 (250 in 0.11+).

      ID of currently set playlist. For now, this sets the preset cycle feature,
      -1 is off and 0 is on.

      If set to true in a JSON POST command, the response will contain the full JSON state object.
      Not included in state response.

      If set to true, device will reboot immediately. Not included in state response.
    example: false
  live:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      If set to true, enters realtime mode and blanks the LEDs. The realtime timeout option
      does not have an effect when this command is used, WLED will stay in realtime mode until
      the state (color/effect/segments, excluding brightness) is changed. It is expected that
      {"live":false} is sent once live data sending is terminated. Not included in state response.
    example: false

    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 2
    description: >
      Live data override. 0 is off, 1 is override until live data ends, 2 is override until
      ESP reboot (available since 0.10.0)

  Segment configuration for controlling individual parts of the LED strip.
  Segments enable running different effects on different parts of the strip.
properties:
  id:
    type: integer
    minimum: -1
    description: >
      Zero-indexed ID of the segment. May be omitted, in that case the ID will be inferred
      from the order of the segment objects in the seg array. -1 means apply to all selected segments.

    minimum: 0
    description: >
      LED the segment stops at, not included in range. If stop is set to a lower or equal
      value than start (setting to 0 is recommended), the segment is invalidated and deleted.

      True if the segment is selected. Selected segments will have their state (color/FX)
      updated by APIs that don't support segments (e.g. UDP sync, HTTP API). If no segment
      is selected, the first segment (id:0) will behave as if selected. WLED will report
      the state of the first (lowest id) segment that is selected to APIs (HTTP, MQTT, Blynk...),
      or mainseg in case no segment is selected and for the UDP API. Live data is always applied
      to all LEDs regardless of segment configuration.

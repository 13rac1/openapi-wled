# Tasklist

- [x] Read the `README.md` to understand what the project is.
- [x] Confirm the git repository is initialized and clean.
- [x] Create `.ai/redocly-cli.md` describing the use of the CLI tool available
      at: https://github.com/redocly/redocly-cli
- [x] Create `.ai/openapi-3.0.md` describing the OpenAPI 3.0 Schema standard.
- [x] Create `.ai/multi-file-definitions.md` describing the use of
      multi-file-definitions.
- [X] Clone `https://github.com/paul-fornage/wled-json-api-library.git` as a submodule
      and commit the change.
- [x] Review the AI documentation in `.ai/docs/*.md` and the `README.md`, then generate a plan of iterative
      tasks in this document `tasks.md` to create a Redocly multi-file OpenAPI 3 Schema based on the Rust
      code in `wled-json-api-library` according to the AI documentation and the `README.md`

## OpenAPI Schema Creation Plan

### Initial Setup Phase
- [ ] Initialize the OpenAPI project structure following the multi-file format
- [ ] Create the root `openapi.yaml` file with basic API information
- [ ] Set up the folder structure for components, paths, and code samples
- [ ] Configure `.redocly.yaml` for linting and documentation settings

### Iterative Development Process
For each major API feature/endpoint group:
1. Analysis Phase
   - [ ] Analyze relevant Rust code in `wled-json-api-library` to identify:
     - [ ] API endpoints and their HTTP methods
     - [ ] Request/response data structures
     - [ ] Common components and reusable schemas
     - [ ] Authentication mechanisms
     - [ ] Error responses

2. Schema Creation Phase
   - [ ] Create or update schemas in `components/schemas/`:
     - [ ] Define data types specific to this feature
     - [ ] Create request/response models
     - [ ] Define error schemas
   - [ ] Create or update path definitions in `paths/`:
     - [ ] Map endpoints to their corresponding path files
     - [ ] Define parameters, request bodies, and responses
     - [ ] Add operation IDs and descriptions
   - [ ] Create or update reusable components:
     - [ ] Define security schemes if needed
     - [ ] Create common parameters
     - [ ] Define response headers

3. Documentation Phase
   - [ ] Add detailed descriptions for new components
   - [ ] Include examples in schema definitions
   - [ ] Add code samples for operations
   - [ ] Update API documentation

4. Validation Phase
   - [ ] Run Redocly linting to validate the schema
   - [ ] Generate and review the API documentation
   - [ ] Fix any validation errors or inconsistencies

### Finalization Phase
- [ ] Bundle the multi-file definition
- [ ] Create a final review of the complete schema
- [ ] Update documentation with any additional information

Note: This process should be repeated for each major feature group in the API, allowing for incremental development and validation of the OpenAPI schema.
